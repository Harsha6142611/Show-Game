## Introduction
This project is a real-time multiplayer card game where users can create game rooms, add bots to the game, and play with custom card decks. The game is built using Node.js and Socket.IO for real-time communication, with a React frontend for user interaction. Bots are included to simulate additional players by automatically making moves during their turns.

---

## Features
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Create and join game rooms to play with others in real-time.
- **Customizable Card Decks**: Define custom card decks at the start of the game.
- **Bots**: Add AI-driven bot players to fill up a game room.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Players and bots take turns to pass cards, and the game is managed via server-side logic.
- **Responsive UI**: The frontend is built using React for a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Libraries & Technologies

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between server and clients.
- **Express**: Simplified HTTP server for API endpoints and serving static files.

### Frontend
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Socket.IO-Client**: To handle real-time communication from the client side.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: The game is a turn-based card game where players pass cards to other players. The goal is to manage your cards effectively and follow game-specific rules (which can vary based on custom implementations).

2. **Number of Players**: The game can have multiple players in a room, either real or AI-controlled bots.

3. **Custom Cards**: Players can submit custom card names to be used in the game.

4. **Turns**: Players take turns passing cards. When it's a bot's turn, a card is randomly picked and passed to the next player.

5. **Winning Conditions**: This can be customized according to the game rules you wish to implement (e.g., first player to pass all their cards wins).
